write a syntax to declare character array?
        char[] ch = new char[5] (Valid Statement).

when an array is passed to a mtd "reference of array" is received by array.

Arrays are "objects" in java, it's a container that holds a fixed number of items of a single type.

Static mtds must only access "static data & call other static mtds, moreover they can't refer this type".

Static keyword makes a variable belong to a class,rather than being defined for each instance of the class.

The Object  created with new keyword during "run-time".

Definiton of package: 
        A package is a collection of classes & interfaces.
