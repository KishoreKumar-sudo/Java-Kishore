Method overriding is the the process of providing the subclass specific method implementation for an inherited 
method.

When a method from super class is inherited to subclass , in subclass we can change the method 
logic by keeping the same method declaration.

If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of 
its parent class, it is known as method overriding.

It is possible only in case of Inheritance.

Usage of Java Method Overriding

Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is 
already provided by its superclass.

Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

Rules for Method overriding:
The return type of method must be same as declared in super class.

Method name must be same as declared in super class.

Signature must be same as declared as in super class. Logic can be different.

Note: we can optionally use an annotation @Override.
